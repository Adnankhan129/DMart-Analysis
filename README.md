   - Sales by city (e.g., New York, Los Angeles).
   - Ship mode by region, with a pie chart showing the percentage of sales in different regions.
   
3. **Quarterly and Yearly Analysis**: 
   - A bar chart illustrates the total count of shipping modes per quarter, allowing the viewer to see sales patterns across the year.
   - Sales are further broken down by ship mode per year, showing trends in logistics and delivery choices over the years.

4. **State-wise Sales**: A bar chart presents a detailed view of sales performance across different states, helping to identify the strongest markets.
